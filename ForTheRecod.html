        <P  id= "firstP">Hello there and welcome to my 45rpm record collection. I used to be a bit of a record collector,
            but about 4 years ago I went digital (which isn't quite the same as Dylan going electric ,but it was a big change).
            I subsequently sold off most of my collection.<br>Anyway, I was  looking for an excuse to play around 
            with some infographics using only CSS (puls a background images) so I chose what's left my 7" singles.

        </P >
        <P id = "secondP">I have 198 records left, which are a mixture of Funk, Soul,RnB,Reggae,Jazz ans Latin I have display 
            them using a variety of staistics which can be seen below.<br>
            for the record:This page has no semantic value, it's just a bit of fun, done purely for my own enjoyment (and hopefully yours).<br>
            Enjoy your stay.
